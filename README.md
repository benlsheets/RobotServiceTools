# RobotServiceTools
Tools for working with industrial robots.

The basic tools are DOS based FTP scripts for loading offline code and backing up live controllers. They can be run directly from the command line or by double clicking on them in Explorer.

Each project will need its own Addresses_Load.txt and Addresses_Save.txt files. These files contain the definitions for the working directories and controller IP addresses that are used by the scripts.
